features to implement:

1. expectation chart's ui needs upgrade, first line is today, second line is any chosen day by user within some days.

2. options ranking fixed, use less dramatic values due to not enough volume traded.

3. sector performance improvement, when clicked on, show some industry info + options focused insight, like option iv skew or oi.

4. stock page needs iv/hv charts and iv smile.

5. 2 oi charts, 1 is historical data on total OI on put/calls, example: yesterday 2000 OI, today has 20k OI, can show in $ or number of contracts.
the other one is current OI visuals, from ATM to OTM, y axis can be the amount (in $ or amount)

6. option summary in the overview page now should be available for all individual stocks, numbers shown in K, or M

7. also in overview, the ITM/OTM ratios, of volume or oi, etc.. improve and add to individual stocks too.
